## 🎓 Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict student academic performance based on various demographic, social, and academic attributes. It uses a dataset containing student-related data and builds predictive models to assist educators and institutions in identifying students at risk and supporting their academic success.

### 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

* Analyze student data to uncover important factors influencing academic performance.
* Apply preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.
* Build and evaluate machine learning models for predicting student final grades.

### 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains various features such as:

* Demographic details (e.g., age, gender)
* Academic background
* Study time and failures
* Family and school support
* Absences and health status

### 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

* **Logistic Regression**
* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
* **Random Forest Classifier**
* **Decision Tree Classifier**

### 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

Models are evaluated using:
